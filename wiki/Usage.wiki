== Placing the code ==

Place your code on the page and surround it with `<pre>` tag. Set `name` 
attribute to `code` and `class` attribute to one of the [Languages language aliases] you wish to use.

{{{
<pre name="code" class="c-sharp">
... some code here ...
</pre>
}}}

*NOTE:* One important thing to watch out for is opening triangular bracket `<`. It must be replaced with an HTML equivalent of `&lt;` in all cases. Failure to do won't break the page, but might break the source code displayed.

An alternative to `<pre>` is to use `<textarea>` tag. There are no problems with `<` character in that case. The main problem is that it doesn't look as good as `<pre>` tag if for some reason JavaScript didn't work (in RSS feed for example).

{{{
<textarea name="code" class="c#" cols="60" rows="10">
... some code here ...
</textarea>
}}}
